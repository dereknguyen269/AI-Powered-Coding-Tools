## 🛡️ Universal Best Practices

The following principles apply to **all AI-assisted coding tools**.  
They help you leverage AI effectively **without sacrificing code quality, security, or architectural consistency**.

### 1. 🎯 Effective Prompting (The Most Critical Skill)

* **Be specific and constrained**  
  Avoid vague prompts. Clearly describe *what* you want, *how* it should be done, and *within which constraints*.  
  > ❌ "Refactor this code"  
  > ✅ "Refactor this function to use async/await, add input validation, and apply TypeScript generics."

* **Define the expected output**  
  Examples:
  - "Generate **unit tests using Jest**"
  - "Return a **Mermaid class diagram**"
  - "Output **only the code diff**, no explanation"

* **Iterate instead of over-prompting**  
  Start simple, review the output, then refine.  
  AI works best in short feedback loops, not one giant prompt.

---

### 2. 📚 Context Is Everything

AI can only produce high-quality results when it understands the **full context**.

* **Explicitly state technical constraints**
  - Frameworks (React Hooks, Spring Boot, FastAPI)
  - Libraries (Zod, Prisma, Pandas)
  - Internal conventions (naming, logging, error handling)

* **Reference related code**
  Do not expect the AI to infer your architecture.
  > *Example:*  
  > "This new endpoint must follow the same error handling pattern as `UserService.ts`."

* **Explain intent and business logic**
  Tell the AI *why* the code exists, not just *what* to write.

---

### 3. 🛡️ Verification and Accountability (Non-Negotiable)

* **Never commit blindly**  
  AI output should be treated as a **draft**, not final production code.

* **Test everything**
  Especially for:
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Data validation
  - Performance-critical paths

* **AI accelerates — it does not replace expertise**  
  If you don't fully understand the generated code, you shouldn't ship it.
