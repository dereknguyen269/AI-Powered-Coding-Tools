## Universal Best Practices

These core strategies apply to **all** AI coding assistants, ensuring you get accurate, high-quality, and contextual suggestions.

### 1. 🎯 Effective Prompting (The Single Most Important Skill)

* **Be Specific and Constrained:** Replace vague requests with **clear, specific, and detailed instructions** (e.g., "Refactor this function to use async/await instead of promises and include proper input validation and TypeScript generics.").
* **Define Output Format:** Specify the expected output (e.g., "Generate a **unit test** using **Jest** for this function," or "Provide a **class diagram** in Mermaid format.").
* **Iterate and Refine:** Start with a simple prompt and **incrementally refine** your request based on the AI's previous output. Don't expect perfection in one go.

### 2. 📚 Context is King (Provide the AI a "Bird's Eye View")

* **Explicitly Provide Constraints:** Always include **contextual requirements** such as the framework (e.g., React hooks, Spring Boot), specific libraries (e.g., Zod, Pandas), and existing patterns.
* **Reference Related Code:** Mention or include **related files, functions, or class names** that the AI needs to understand to maintain architectural consistency.
    > *Example*: Explain your goal: "I'm creating a new API endpoint. It must follow the same error handling and logging pattern as in the `UserService.ts` file."
* **Explain Intent/Business Logic:** Tell the AI *why* the code exists or what the feature is meant to achieve, not just *what* to write.

### 3. 🛡️ Verification and Validation (Your Responsibility)

* **Review Before Committing:** **Never blindly accept** generated code. Treat AI output as a draft that requires human review for logic, edge cases, and security.
* **Test Generated Code:** Prioritize **testing** (manual and automated) on AI-generated components, especially security-critical or performance-sensitive parts.
* **Maintain Fundamentals:** Use AI to **accelerate** your work, not replace your understanding. You must still be the domain expert and final arbiter of code quality.
